# The `sashash` package, version: `0.0.1`;
  
---
 
Description: The sashash package provides powerful and efficient hash-based lookup and validation tools specifically designed for SAS programming. Leveraging the robust capabilities of SAS hash objects, this package enables rapid and dynamic key-based data retrieval and existence checking directly within a single data step. This significantly reduces the need for separate sort and merge steps, streamlining workflows and enhancing performance.

Concept: The core strength of the sashash package is its ability to simplify and accelerate data processing tasks by eliminating repetitive data sort and merge operations. Users can perform multiple data joins and validations dynamically within a single SAS data step, using keys generated on-the-fly during processing, thereby dramatically improving both flexibility and speed.

Included Macros:

kvlookup Macro:

Purpose: Enables efficient and dynamic retrieval of variables from a specified master dataset based on provided keys, directly within a single data step without separate sorting or merging.

Usage Example:

%kvlookup(master=sashelp.class,
          key=Name,
          var=Age Sex,
          wh=Age > 12,
          warn=Y,
          dropviewflg=Y);

keycheck Macro:

Purpose: Dynamically validates the existence of keys within a master dataset directly within a single data step. Ideal for rapid data integrity checks and immediate flagging of key existence or non-existence.

Usage Example:

%keycheck(master=sashelp.class,
          key=Name,
          wh=Age >= 15,
          fl=exist_flag,
          cat=YN,
          dropviewflg=Y);

Ideal for:

Data analysts and SAS programmers dealing with large datasets requiring multiple lookups or validations.

Scenarios where performance and flexibility are critical, eliminating the overhead associated with separate sort and merge operations.

Complex data processing tasks where keys must be dynamically generated and validated within the data step.

The sashash package dramatically simplifies complex data manipulations, enabling faster, more efficient, and flexible data processing within SAS.

* MACRO NAME: keycheck
*
* PURPOSE:
*   Checks the existence of specified key(s) in a master dataset using
*   a hash object. Optionally subsets master data using conditions and
*   returns results as categorical (YN) or numerical indicators.
*
* PARAMETERS:
*   master     : (Required) Name of the master dataset to check against.
*   key        : (Required) Space-separated list of key variables to check.
*   wh         : (Optional) SQL WHERE clause condition to subset the master
*                dataset before loading into hash table. Default is none.
*   fl         : (Required) Name of the output variable indicating existence.
*   cat        : (Optional) Controls output format of existence indicator:
*                   - 'YN' (default): Returns 'Y' if key exists, 'N' otherwise.
*                   - 'NUM': Returns 1 if key exists, 0 otherwise.
*   dropviewflg: (Optional) Y/N flag. If 'Y', drops temporary SQL view created
*                when the 'wh' parameter is used. Default is 'Y'.
*
* USAGE:
*   %keycheck(master=sashelp.class,
*             key=Name,
*             wh=Age >= 15,
*             fl=exist_flag,
*             cat=YN,
*             dropviewflg=Y);
*
* NOTES:
*   - This macro creates a hash object on the first record processed.
*   - Efficient for repeated existence checks within data steps.
*   - The macro automatically cleans up temporary views unless explicitly
*     disabled by setting dropviewflg=N.

## `%kvlookup()` macro <a name="kvlookup-macros-5"></a> ######

* MACRO NAME: kvlookup
*
* PURPOSE:
*   Performs a hash table lookup to efficiently retrieve variables from a
*   master dataset based on specified keys. Optionally subsets master data
*   using a condition and manages temporary views.
*
* PARAMETERS:
*   master     : (Required) Name of the master dataset to lookup from.
*   key        : (Required) Space-separated list of key variables for the lookup.
*   var        : (Required) Space-separated list of variables to retrieve from
*                the master dataset. Default is none.
*   wh         : (Optional) SQL WHERE clause condition to subset the master
*                dataset before loading into hash table. Default is none.
*   warn       : (Optional) Y/N flag. If 'Y', issues a warning in the log
*                when the lookup key is not found. Default is 'N'.
*   dropviewflg: (Optional) Y/N flag. If 'Y', drops temporary SQL view created
*                when the 'wh' parameter is used. Default is 'Y'.
*
* USAGE:
*   %kvlookup(master=sashelp.class,
*             key=Name,
*             var=Age Sex,
*             wh=Age > 12,
*             warn=Y,
*             dropviewflg=Y);
*
* NOTES:
*   - This macro creates a hash object dynamically on the first execution,
*     improving performance for repeated lookups.
*   - Ensure keys specified uniquely identify records in the master dataset.
*   - The macro automatically cleans up temporary views unless explicitly
*     disabled by setting dropviewflg=N.
