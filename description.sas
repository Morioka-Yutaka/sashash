DESCRIPTION START:
Description: The sashash package provides powerful and efficient hash-based lookup and validation tools specifically designed for SAS programming. Leveraging the robust capabilities of SAS hash objects, this package enables rapid and dynamic key-based data retrieval and existence checking directly within a single data step. This significantly reduces the need for separate sort and merge steps, streamlining workflows and enhancing performance.
Concept: The core strength of the sashash package is its ability to simplify and accelerate data processing tasks by eliminating repetitive data sort and merge operations. Users can perform multiple data joins and validations dynamically within a single SAS data step, using keys generated on-the-fly during processing, thereby dramatically improving both flexibility and speed.
