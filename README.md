# sashash
The sashash package provides powerful and efficient hash-based lookup and validation tools specifically designed for SAS programming. Leveraging the robust capabilities of SAS hash objects, this package enables rapid and dynamic key-based data retrieval and existence checking directly within a single data step. This significantly reduces the need for separate sort and merge steps, streamlining workflows and enhancing performance.

# %kvlookup()
Enables efficient and dynamic retrieval of variables from a specified master dataset based on provided keys, directly within a single data step without separate sorting or merging.<br>
Usage Example:<br>

~~~sas  
%kvlookup(master=sashelp.class,
          key=Name,         
          var=Age Sex,<br>
          wh=ã€€%nrbquote(Age > 12),
          warn=Y,
          dropviewflg=Y);
~~~

# %keycheck()
Dynamically validates the existence of keys within a master dataset directly within a single data step. Ideal for rapid data integrity checks and immediate flagging of key existence or non-existence.<br>
Usage Example:<br>

%keycheck(master=sashelp.class,<br>
          key=Name,<br>
          wh= %nrbquote(Age >= 15),<br>
          fl=exist_flag,<br>
          cat=YN,<br>
          dropviewflg=Y);<br>
